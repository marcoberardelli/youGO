### A tool for downloading music from youtube playlists and videos.

This project is a wrapper of the famous [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), but with a new feature that _tries_ to detect the name and the artist of the song from the video's title and put them in the file's metadata.



### Requirements:
- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
